# Executive Summary


# Classification Definitions

## Risk Classification

Level                                   | Score | Description
----------|-----|--------------------------------------------------
\cellcolor{risklevelcritical}{Critical} | 10    | The vulnerability poses an immediate threat to the organization. Successful exploitation may permanently affect the organization. Remediation should be immediately performed. 
\cellcolor{risklevelhigh}{High}         | 7-9   | The vulnerability poses an urgent threat to the organization, and remediation should be prioritized.
\cellcolor{risklevelmedium}{Medium}     | 4-6   | Successful exploitation is possible and may result in notable disruption of business functionality. This vulnerability should be remediated when feasible.
\cellcolor{risklevellow}{Low}           | 1-3   | The vulnerability poses a negligible/minimal threat to the organization. The presence of this vulnerability should be noted and remediated if possible.
\cellcolor{gray}{Information}           | 0     | These findings have no clear threat to the organization, but may cause business processes to function differently than desired or reveal sensitive information about the company.

## Exploitation Likelihood Classifications

Likelihood | Description
----------|--------------------------------------------------
\cellcolor{pastelred}{Likely}        | Exploitation methods are well-known and can be performed using publicly available tools. Low-skilled attackers and automated tools could successfully exploit the vulnerability with minimal difficulty.
\cellcolor{pastelyellow}{Possible}   | Exploitation methods are well-known, may be performed using public tools, but require configuration. Understanding of the underlying system is required for successful exploitation.
\cellcolor{pastelgreen}{Unlikely}    | Exploitation requires deep understanding of the underlying systems or advanced technical skills. Precise conditions may be required for successful exploitation.

## Business Impact Classifications

Impact | Description
----------|--------------------------------------------------
\cellcolor{pastelred}{Major}        | Successful exploitation may result in large disruptions of critical business functions across the organization and significant financial damage.
\cellcolor{pastelyellow}{Moderate}   | Successful exploitation may cause significant disruptions to non-critical business functions.
\cellcolor{pastelgreen}{Minor}    | Successful exploitation may affect few users, without causing much disruption to routine business functions.

## Remediation Difficulty Classifications

Difficulty | Description
----------|--------------------------------------------------
\cellcolor{pastelred}{Hard}        | Remediation may require extensive reconfiguration of underlying systems that is time consuming. Remediation may require disruption of normal business functions.
\cellcolor{pastelyellow}{Moderate}   | Remediation may require minor reconfigurations or additions that may be time-intensive or expensive.
\cellcolor{pastelgreen}{Easy}    | Remediation can be accomplished in a short amount of time, with little difficulty.


# Scope

The scope of the Pentest are the two ip addresses 10.1.0.5 and fd01::5 which are mapped to the same machine. The Pentest was initiated as a blackbox test since there was no information provided except for the ip addresses.


# Findings

## Operating System

The target systems runs on the latest stable version of Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) and has the hostname `secureding`. Furthermore it is running on the fairly recent kernel version `5.10.84-1 (2021-12-08)` with up to date packages installed from the debian stabel repo.

### Missing Security Updates

The `/etc/apt/sources.list` only contains the following single line of repos

```s
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian bullseye main
```

#### Recommendations

It is strongly recommendet to add the official debian security repo to the list by appending the following line

```s
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main
```

Optionally the `bullseye-updates` repo can also be enabled, but this contains just feature related updates.


## Apache Webserver

There is an Apache webserver version `2.4.51` installed from the debian stable repo. The webserver is listening on port 80 without beeing bound to a specific ip address.

### Missing Security Update

This version of Apache is vulnerable to the following CVEs

CVE | Score | Short Description
--|-|-----
CVE-2021-44790 | **\textcolor{risklevelcritical}{9.8}** | Possible buffer overflow when parsing multipart content in mod_lua
CVE-2021-44224 | **\textcolor{risklevelhigh}{8.2}** | Possible NULL dereference or SSRF in forward proxy configurations


### Directory Listing


### Unencrypted Communication

Classification

  - Risk: 
  - Exploitation Likelihood: 
  - Business Impact: 
  - Remediation Difficulty: 

### Recommendations

Install the the security updates with Apache version `2.4.52`.
